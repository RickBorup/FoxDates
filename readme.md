**FoxDates** is a collection of functions to help Visual FoxPro developers work with dates and times. 

See the [FoxDates Documentation](FoxDates_Docs.md) for a list of the functions and what they do. The documentation is also included as a [PDF](FoxDates_Docs.pdf).

This project includes a set of [FoxUnit](https://github.com/VFPX/FoxUnit) tests for the functions - see *clsFoxDatesTest.prg*.
